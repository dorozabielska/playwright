# Playwright Project with MyMentor ChatGPT 4o

## Description
This is my learning project for automation with Playwright and Node.js. If you like it, you can use it or you can simply copy my initial input and start your journey too.

### This is my initial input for MyMentor :sweat_smile: 
> I would like you to act as my mentor in QA test automation. The technology I want to learn is UI automation using Node.js with the Playwright framework. I don't have any experience, but I want you to throw me in at the deep end.
>
> A few things for you to know:
>
> 1. I have macOS (version reducted).
> 2. I have a GitHub account, and I want to publish all my tests there.
> 3. I don't have a code editor at the moment. Please suggest one that works on Mac and supports GitHub Copilot.
> 4. I don't have a website to test. Please choose one that was created by the QA community for automation training purposes.
